\section*{}

The implementation of an efficient and reliable self-localization method will allow the deployment of robots in dynamic environments to help human co-workers improve the overall productivity and reduce the time and costs of manufacturing.

There are several approaches that can be used to estimate a robot pose according to the target environment and accuracy requirements. This dissertation tackled this problem by providing a modular and configurable localization system that can be used for pose tracking and initial localization estimation.
