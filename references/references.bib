abstract = {Localization, namely pose estimation is of great importance in the research of intelligent vehicles. In this paper, after a simple overview of existing methods, a method of laser radar localization based on landmark pairs (L<sup>3</sup>P) is presented, which is an improved algorithm of localization based on landmarks to overcome problems of traditional methods, such as low reliability and low robustness of landmark detection, etc. This algorithm has been verified on both synthetic data and real range data in the outdoor environment. Experimental results demonstrate its high accuracy, high robustness to noises and low computation.},

@article{Blanco2010,
abstract = {In this work we address the problem of optimal Bayesian filtering for dynamic systems with observation models that cannot be approximated properly as any parameterized distribution. In the context of mobile robots this problem arises in localization and simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) with occupancy grid maps. The lack of a parameterized observation model for these maps forces a sample-based representation, commonly through Monte Carlo methods for sequential filtering, also called particle filters. Our work is grounded on the demonstrated existence of an optimal proposal distribution for particle filters. However, this optimal distribution is not directly applicable to systems with non-parametric models. By integrating ideas from previous works on adaptive sample size, auxiliary particle filters, and rejection sampling, we derive a new particle filter algorithm that enables the usage of the optimal proposal to estimate the true posterior density of a non-parametric dynamic system. This new filter is better suited, both theoretically and in practice, than previous approximate methods for indoor and outdoor localization and SLAM, as confirmed by experiments with real robots.},

@article{Tuna2012,
abstract = {Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) algorithms with multiple autonomous robots have received considerable attention in recent years. In general, SLAM algorithms use odometry information and measurements from exteroceptive sensors of robots. The accuracy of these measurements and the performance of the corresponding SLAM algorithm directly affect the overall success of the system. This paper presents comparative performance evaluations of three Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) algorithms using Extended Kalman Filter (EKF), Compressed Extended Kalman Filter (CEKF) and Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF). Specifically, it focuses on their SLAM performances and processing time requirements. To show the effect of CPU power on the processing time of SLAM algorithms, two notebooks and a netbook with different specifications have been used. Comparative simulation results show that processing time requirements are consistent with the computational complexities of SLAM algorithms. The results we obtained are consistent with the CPU power tests of independent organizations and show that higher processing power decreases processing time accordingly. The results also show that CEKF is more suitable for outdoor SLAM applications where there are a lot of natural and artificial features.},

@article{Bshara2010,
abstract = {This paper considers the problem of fingerprinting localization in wireless networks based on received-signal-strength (RSS) observations. First, the performance of static localization using power maps (PMs) is improved with a new approach called the base-station-strict (BS-strict) methodology, which emphasizes the effect of BS identities in the classical fingerprinting. Second, dynamic motion models with and without road network information are used to further improve the accuracy via particle filters. The likelihood-calculation mechanism proposed for the particle filters is interpreted as a soft version (called BS-soft) of the BS-strict approach applied in the static case. The results of the proposed approaches are illustrated and compared with an example whose data were collected from a WiMAX network in a challenging urban area in the capitol city of Brussels, Belgium.},

abstract = {In urban environments, detection of moving obstacles and free space determination are key issues for driving assistance systems or autonomous vehicles. This paper presents a lidar-based perception system for passenger-cars, able to do simultaneously mapping and moving obstacles detection. Nowadays, many lidars provide multi-layer and multi-echo measurements. A smart way to handle this multi-modality is to use grids projected on the road surface in both global and local frames. The global one generates the mapping and the local is used to deal with moving objects. An approach based on both positive and negative accumulation has been developed to address the remnant problem of quickly moving obstacles. This method is also well suited for multi-layer and multi-echo sensors. Experimental results carried out with an IBEO Alasca and an Applanix positioning system show the performance of such a perception strategy.},

@article{Wan2002,
abstract = {This paper points out the flaws in using the extended Kalman filter (EKE) and introduces an improvement, the unscented Kalman filter (UKF), proposed by Julier and Uhlman (1997). A central and vital operation performed in the Kalman filter is the propagation of a Gaussian random variable (GRV) through the system dynamics. In the EKF the state distribution is approximated by a GRV, which is then propagated analytically through the first-order linearization of the nonlinear system. This can introduce large errors in the true posterior mean and covariance of the transformed GRV, which may lead to sub-optimal performance and sometimes divergence of the filter. The UKF addresses this problem by using a deterministic sampling approach. The state distribution is again approximated by a GRV, but is now represented using a minimal set of carefully chosen sample points. These sample points completely capture the true mean and covariance of the GRV, and when propagated through the true nonlinear system, captures the posterior mean and covariance accurately to the 3rd order (Taylor series expansion) for any nonlinearity. The EKF in contrast, only achieves first-order accuracy. Remarkably, the computational complexity of the UKF is the same order as that of the EKF. Julier and Uhlman demonstrated the substantial performance gains of the UKF in the context of state-estimation for nonlinear control. Machine learning problems were not considered. We extend the use of the UKF to a broader class of nonlinear estimation problems, including nonlinear system identification, training of neural networks, and dual estimation problems. In this paper, the algorithms are further developed and illustrated with a number of additional examples},

@article{Lee2006,
abstract = {For robust 3D object recognition in the environment having diverse variances, it is necessary to increase the certainty by using consecutive scenes rather than using a single scene and combining different features. This paper proposes a novel 3D object recognition and pose estimation approach based on combining photometric feature (SIFT) and geometric feature (3D lines) in a sequence of scenes. In order to utilize the consecutive scenes, we use the particle filtering method and all particles which represent the possible pose of object are generated by each feature. These particles are to be spread out where the object is considered to exist, and the probability of each particle is obtained through matching test with each feature in the scene. Then the particle sets derived from SIFT and 3D lines are fused and it gives a pose of the object estimated. For the sake of computational efficiency, this recognition system is performed in a hierarchical process. In this paper, we also introduce a simple method to decide the next best view position based on results of recognition. Lastly we have proved through experiments that the proposed methods are feasible},

@article{Besl1992,
abstract = {The authors describe a general-purpose, representation-independent method for the accurate and computationally efficient registration of 3-D shapes including free-form curves and surfaces. The method handles the full six degrees of freedom and is based on the iterative closest point (ICP) algorithm, which requires only a procedure to find the closest point on a geometric entity to a given point. The ICP algorithm always converges monotonically to the nearest local minimum of a mean-square distance metric, and the rate of convergence is rapid during the first few iterations. Therefore, given an adequate set of initial rotations and translations for a particular class of objects with a certain level of 'shape complexity,' one can globally minimize the mean-square distance metric over all six degrees of freedom by testing each initial registration. One important application of this method is to register sensed data from unfixtured rigid objects with an ideal geometric model prior to shape inspection. Experimental results show the capabilities of the registration algorithm on point sets, curves, and surfaces.},

Many variants of ICP have been proposed, affecting all phases of the algorithm from the se- lection and matching of points to the minimization strategy. We enumerate and classify many of these variants, and evaluate their effect on the speed with which the correct alignment is reached. In order to improve convergence for nearly-flat meshes with small features, such as inscribed surfaces, we introduce a new variant based on uniform sampling of the space of normals. We conclude by proposing a combination of ICP variants optimized for high speed. We demonstrate an implementation that is able to align two range images in a few tens of milliseconds, assuming a good initial guess. This capability has potential application to real-time 3D model acquisition and model-based tracking.},

abstract = {The paper presents an enhanced dead reckoning system that fuses data coming from odometry and gyroscope for a more reliable position estimate. Taking into account noise and drift properties of both odometry and gyroscope, and employing some rule-based algorithm, the system improves local self-localization by reducing the effect of non-systematic odometric errors caused by unpredictable bumps or uncertainty encountered in the navigation environment. Another type of error which may occur in passive robots has been considered, e.g. lifting up the iWalker and performing some rotational motion while the contact between the rear wheels and the ground is lost. The bias term of the angular rate sensor has been estimated by Extended Kalman Filter every time the walker temporarily stops. The performance of the proposed localization system has been tested on the iWalker platform for both normal and abnormal cases. Experimental results show the efficiency of this low cost dead reckoning system.},

abstract = {In this paper, we propose a system to cope with the problem of autonomous mobile robot navigation. It is able to perform path planning and localize the robot in the real world environment. The path planning is first carried out using the known map, and the laser range scanner is then used to localize the robot based on the ICP registration technique. During the robot motion, the potential field is taken into account for obstacle avoidance. For the path planning, the visibility graph is established based on the current position of the robot. The Dijkstra algorithm is then used to find the shortest path to the goal position. Experimental results for both the simulation and real world environment are presented.},

@article{Bouaziz2013,
abstract = {Rigid registration of two geometric data sets is essential in many applications, including robot navigation, surface reconstruction, and shape matching. Most commonly, variants of the Iterative Closest Point (ICP) algorithm are employed for this task. These methods alternate between closest point computations to establish correspondences between two data sets, and solving for the optimal transformation that brings these correspondences into alignment. A major difficulty for this approach is the sensitivity to outliers and missing data often observed in 3D scans. Most practical implementations of the ICP algorithm address this issue with a number of heuristics to prune or re-weight correspondences. However, these heuristics can be unreliable and difficult to tune, which often requires substantial manual assistance. We propose a new formulation of the ICP algorithm that avoids these difficulties by formulating the registration optimization using sparsity inducing norms. Our new algorithm retains the simple structure of the ICP algorithm, while achieving superior registration results when dealing with outliers and incomplete data.},

In this paper two types of sensor fusions are proposed to improve the reliability of GPS navigation in such environments: (1) the integration of GPS with other GNSS, including GLONASS and GALILEO, and (2) the integration of GPS with low-cost INS. Numerical results demonstrate that both methods will significantly improve the robustness and accuracy when the number of tracked GPS satellite is insufficient to generate reliable results.},

@article{Arulampalam2002,
abstract = {Increasingly, for many application areas, it is becoming important
to include elements of nonlinearity and non-Gaussianity in order to
model accurately the underlying dynamics of a physical system. Moreover,
it is typically crucial to process data on-line as it arrives, both from
the point of view of storage costs as well as for rapid adaptation to
changing signal characteristics. In this paper, we review both optimal
and suboptimal Bayesian algorithms for nonlinear/non-Gaussian tracking
problems, with a focus on particle filters. Particle filters are
sequential Monte Carlo methods based on point mass (or "particle")
representations of probability densities, which can be applied to any
state-space model and which generalize the traditional Kalman filtering
methods. Several variants of the particle filter such as SIR, ASIR, and
RPF are introduced within a generic framework of the sequential
importance sampling (SIS) algorithm. These are discussed and compared
with the standard EKF through an illustrative example},

@article{Julier1997,
abstract = {The Kalman filter(KF) is one of the most widely used methods for tracking and estimation due to its simplicity, optimality, tractability and robustness. However, the application of the KF to nonlinear systems can be difficult. The most common approach is to use the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) which simply linearises all nonlinear models so that the traditional linear Kalman filter can be applied. Although the EKF (in its many forms) is a widely used filtering strategy, over thirty years of experience with it has led to a general consensus within the tracking and control community that it is difficult to implement, difficult to tune, and only reliable for systems which are almost linear on the time scale of the update intervals. In this paper a new linear estimator is developed and demonstrated. Using the principle that a set of discretely sampled points can be used to parameterise mean and covariance, the estimator yields performance equivalent to the KF for linear systems yet generalises elegantly to nonlinear systems without the linearisation steps required by the EKF. We show analytically that the expected performance of the new approach is superior to that of the EKF and, in fact, is directly comparable to that of the second order Gauss filter. The method is not restricted to assuming that the distributions of noise sources are Gaussian. We argue that the ease of implementation and more accurate estimation features of the new filter recommend its use over the EKF in virtually all applications.},

abstract = {In this self-contained survey/review paper, we system- atically investigate the roots of Bayesian filtering as well as its rich leaves in the literature. Stochastic filtering theory is briefly reviewed with emphasis on nonlinear and non-Gaussian filtering. Following the Bayesian statistics, different Bayesian filtering techniques are de- veloped given different scenarios. Under linear quadratic Gaussian circumstance, the celebrated Kalman filter can be derived within the Bayesian framework. Optimal/suboptimal nonlinear filtering tech- niques are extensively investigated. In particular, we focus our at- tention on the Bayesian filtering approach based on sequential Monte Carlo sampling, the so-called particle filters. Many variants of the particle filter as well as their features (strengths and weaknesses) are discussed. Related theoretical and practical issues are addressed in detail. In addition, some other (new) directions on Bayesian filtering are also explored.},
